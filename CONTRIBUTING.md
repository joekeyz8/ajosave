## Pull Requests

1. Branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
2. Make changes with tests where applicable
3. Open PR against `develop`

Contract lives in `contracts/ajo/`. Write tests in `src/lib.rs`. Run `npm run contract:test` before submitting.

Security-sensitive contract changes require two approvals.
